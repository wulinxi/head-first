            interesting places on the way:Walla Walla ,WA,Magic city,ID,
            Bountiful,UT,Last Chinese ,CO,Why,AZ and Truth or Cousequence,
            NM.

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>    
    <blockquote>
        Passing cars,
        When you can't see,
        May get you,
        A glimpse,
        of eternity.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.

            My first day of the trip I can't believe finally got everything
            packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway.I wasn't able to
            bring a whole lot with me:cell phone,ipad,digital camera,and a
            protein bar.Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,<q>A
            journey of a thousand mils begins with one Segway</q>.
