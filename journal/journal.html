            Well I made it 1200 miles already,and I passed through some
            interesting places on the way:Walla Walla ,WA,Magic city,ID,
            Bountiful,UT,Last Chinese ,CO,Why,AZ and Truth or Cousequence,
            NM.

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:"Passing
        cars,When you can't see,May get you.A glimpse,of eternity.I definitely won't
        be passing any cars

            My first day of the trip I can't believe finally got everything
            packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a Segway.I wasn't able to
            bring a whole lot with me:cell phone,ipad,digital camera,and a
            protein bar.Just the essentials.As Lao Tzu would have said,"A
            journey of a thousand mils begins with one Segway."
